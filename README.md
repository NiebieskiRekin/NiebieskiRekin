### Hi there 👋
My name is Tomasz Pawłowski. I study at Poznań University of Technology. I mostly use Python and C++ with plenty more domain specific languages. I'm expanding my skillset to become a DevOps engineer.

I'm interested in IT topics ranging from cloud solutions, infrastructure, backend development, operating systems (with Linux as my preferred choice), to low level embedded systems. As always I'm keen on learning new things and open to fresh suggestions.
